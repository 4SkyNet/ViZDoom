- think about replay
- epsilon anealing (NeuralQLearner.lua, lines 373-375)
- how is history managed
- loss function? (squared_error used now)
- update function? (adagrad for now - adagrad sucked, nesterov momentum/sgd used)
- handle reshaping properly
- replay and minibatches
- no miss penalty results in shooting constantly
- TODO exploration should be guided
